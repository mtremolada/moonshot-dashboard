A **seafood restaurant/bar** in New Bedford, Massachusetts called **The Black Whale** (often paired with \u201cThe Sail Loft\u201d).  \n  2. An **episode title** (\u201cThe Black Whale\u201d) of the classic U.S. radio series **CBS Radio Mystery Theater** (aired\u202fSeptember\u202f25\u202f1975).  \n\n**Origin / timeline**  \n- **Restaurant** \u2013 The Black Whale Bar & Fish House has operated in New Bedford since the early\u202f2000s, becoming a local landmark for New England seafood. It is referenced in corporate histories of regional restaurant chains.  \n- **Radio episode** \u2013 \u201cThe Black Whale\u201d was broadcast as part of the CBS Radio Mystery Theater anthology in 1975; the episode\u2019s plot involved a mysterious sea creature, reflecting the era\u2019s fascination with maritime horror stories.\n\n**Sources**  \n- *Not Your Average\u202fJoe\u2019s* Wikipedia entry \u2013 notes the acquisition of \u201cThe Black\u202fWhale\u201d restaurant in New\u202fBedford (shows the name\u2019s use as a real\u2011world eatery). \u3010https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Your_Average_Joe%27s\u3011 \u2013 local restaurant reference.  \n- *CBS Radio Mystery Theater* Wikipedia entry \u2013 lists \u201cThe Black Whale\u201d (Sept\u202f25\u202f1975) as one of the show\u2019s episodes (demonstrates the phrase\u2019s use in 1970s radio drama). \u3010https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Radio_Mystery_Theater\u3011 \u2013 episode title reference.  \n\n*No verifiable non\u2011crypto meme, slang, or TikTok\u2011style usage of \u201cThe Black Whale\u201d was found.*",

Summary \u2013 non\u2011crypto meaning of \u201cPippin\u201d**  \n- **Pippin** is most widely recognized as **Peregrin \u201cPippin\u201d Took**, a youthful hobbit from J.R.R.\u202fTolkien\u2019s *The Lord of the Rings* who, together with Merry, provides comic relief, bravery, and a \u201csmall\u2011but\u2011heroic\u201d archetype.  \n- The name also exists as an **old Frankish given name** (Pepin/Pippin) meaning \u201ca small apple\u201d or \u201ca young, fresh fruit,\u201d later borne by medieval royalty (e.g., Pepin the Short).  \n- In popular culture the term appears in the **1972 Broadway musical \u201cPippin,\u201d** about a young prince searching for meaning, further cementing the name as a symbol of youthful adventure and self\u2011discovery.\n\n**2. Origin / Timeline (cultural)**  \n- **c.\u202f8th\u202fcentury\u202f\u2013\u202f9th\u202fcentury:** \u201cPepin\u201d (Latin *Pippinus*) used among Frankish royalty (e.g., Pepin the Short, 714\u2011768).  \n- **1954\u20111955:** Tolkien publishes *The Lord of the Rings*; the character Pippin becomes a beloved figure in fantasy literature and later film (2001\u20112003).  \n- **1972:** Stephen Schwartz\u2019s musical *Pippin* premieres on Broadway, popularizing the name in theatre and later in TV/film adaptations.  \n- **2000s\u2011present:** \u201cPippin\u201d circulates as a meme\u2011friendly shorthand for a quirky, eager underdog (e.g., fan art, AI\u2011agent jokes referencing \u201cPippin the agent\u201d).  \n\n**3. Sources**  \n- **Peregrin \u201cPippin\u201d Took \u2013 Wikipedia** \u2013 details the hobbit character and his cultural impact.  \n- **Pippin (name) \u2013 Wikipedia** \u2013 explains the Frankish origin, meaning \u201cyoung apple,\u201d and historic bearers.  \n\nThese sources confirm that the token\u2019s name most plausibly draws on the well\u2011known literary/folk figure \u201cPippin\u201d rather than any crypto\u2011specific concept.",

The only content is the warning page itself (see link above).  \n\n**Key points (derived from the domain content)**  \n- The page explicitly warns that $ACT is **misleadingly marketed** and **not connected** to the genuine Act\u202fI project.  \n- It claims the developers have **stolen Act\u202fI trademarks** and continue to **promote a false association**.  \n- The site has **requested the scammers stop using the IP**, indicating the token\u2019s promoters are uncooperative.  \n- No **official developers, team information, or technical specifications** are provided.  \n- There are **no links** to a white\u2011paper, audit report, token\u2011omics breakdown, or roadmap on the domain.  \n\n**Gaps / red flags**  \n- **Absence of any formal documentation** (white\u2011paper, lite\u2011paper, audit, token\u2011omics, roadmap) on the official site.  \n- The sole page is a **scam warning**, not a product description.  \n- **Trademark infringement** claim suggests illegal use of the Act\u202fI brand.  \n- Lack of **team or developer transparency** and no verifiable code repositories or audits.  \n\n*Conclusion*: Based solely on the content hosted at\u202fcyborgism.wiki, \u201cAct\u202fI\u202f:\u202fThe\u202fAI\u202fProphecy\u201d ($ACT) appears to be a fraudulent token with no legitimate documentation or product details available on the domain.",

Cultural context includes Rocky Mountain oyster festivals and TikTok/YouTube humor.",

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle) \u2013 comprehensive non\u2011crypto overview.  \n- **Simple English Wikipedia \u2013 Testicle** \u2013 lists common slang terms and cultural notes (e.g., Urdu \u201ctattay\u201d).

Trading fees are determined based on market-cap, gradually reducing as a project grows to support long-term sustainability, or exponentially, with trading fees starting high and dropping quickly to deter snipers.

Here, I\u2019m applying a wide-range SPOT strategy, single-sided in SOL, set at -85%, and I let it run for 2 hours to walk away with 10% profit.  That\u2019s the big advantage of wide ranges: you get an insane risk\u2013reward, and hitting 5%\u201310% is fairly easy.  And even in the video, I miss the first exit because I went for a run on the beach but it\u2019s a strategy that usually lasts anywhere between 2 and 16 hours, without needing much monitoring.

          "answer": "**Summary \u2013 non\u2011crypto meaning**  \n- **\u201cDino\u201d** is widely used in internet culture as a shorthand for \u201cdinosaur,\u201d often to mock something or someone as outdated, clumsy, or \u201cold\u2011school.\u201d  \n- The most recognizable meme\u2011origin of the word is the **Flintstones\u2019 pet dinosaur \u201cDino,\u201d** whose exaggerated reactions (e.g., jumping, barking) are repeatedly clipped into short TikTok/YouTube memes.  \n- No distinct cultural or slang term **\u201cDinosol\u201d** appears in mainstream meme databases, news archives, or linguistic references; the token\u2019s name seems to be a creative blend of \u201cdino\u201d\u202f+\u202f\u201csol\u201d (Spanish for \u201csun\u201d) rather than a pre\u2011existing meme.\n\n**Origin / timeline (non\u2011crypto)**  \n- **Flintstones \u201cDino\u201d** debuted in the 1960s TV series; the character resurfaced as a meme in the 2010s\u20112020s when short video clips of the dog\u2011like dinosaur\u2019s excited behavior were shared on TikTok, Instagram Reels, and meme\u2011sharing sites.  \n- **\u201cDino\u201d as slang** for \u201cdinosaur\u201d (meaning something obsolete or uncool) has been documented in English\u2011language slang dictionaries since the early 2000s and is frequently used in online commentary and meme captions.  \n- **\u201cDinosol\u201d** has no traceable usage outside the token context; searches across meme\u2011focused and mainstream media sites return only the token itself.\n\n**Sources**  \n- Know Your Meme \u2013 *Dino (Flintstones)* \u2013 explains the character\u2019s meme resurgence on TikTok/YouTube. https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/dino\u2011flintstones (shows meme origin)  \n- Wikipedia \u2013 *Dinosaur (slang)* \u2013 outlines \u201cdino\u201d as a slang term for something outdated. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_(slang) (provides linguistic background)  \n\n*Conclusion:* The token\u2019s name draws on the generic \u201cdino\u201d meme/ slang culture; there is no verifiable non\u2011crypto cultural reference for the specific term \u201cDinosol.\u201d",

All documented origins tie the term to a 2013 Bitcoin\u2011forum typo and its later back\u2011ronym \u201cHold\u202fOn\u202fFor\u202fDear\u202fLife.\u201d  \n\n**Origin / timeline (non\u2011crypto)**  \n- 2013\u202f\u2013\u202fBitcoin Talk user *GameKyuubi* posts \u201cI\u202fAM\u202fHODLING\u201d after a market crash; the misspelling of \u201chold\u201d spawns the meme.  \n- 2014\u202f\u2013\u202fReddit users begin spreading the typo, coining the back\u2011ronym \u201cHold\u202fOn\u202fFor\u202fDear\u202fLife\u201d (HODL).  \n- Subsequent years see the term used in memes, videos, and pop\u2011culture references, but each instance traces back to the original crypto\u2011forum post. No earlier or independent cultural source has been identified.  \n\n**Sources**  \n1. **Know Your Meme \u2013 \u201cHODL\u201d** \u2013 details the 2013 forum post and Reddit spread; confirms crypto\u2011only origin. https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hodl (cultural meme analysis)  \n2. **Wikipedia \u2013 \u201cHODL\u201d** \u2013 notes the misspelling on Bitcoin Talk and the later back\u2011ronym; no pre\u2011crypto usage recorded. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HODL (summary of origin)  \n\n*Conclusion:* The term \u201cHODL\u201d is rooted in cryptocurrency slang; no independent non\u2011crypto cultural origin could be located.",
