A **seafood restaurant/bar** in New Bedford, Massachusetts called **The Black Whale** (often paired with \u201cThe Sail Loft\u201d).  \n  2. An **episode title** (\u201cThe Black Whale\u201d) of the classic U.S. radio series **CBS Radio Mystery Theater** (aired\u202fSeptember\u202f25\u202f1975).  \n\n**Origin / timeline**  \n- **Restaurant** \u2013 The Black Whale Bar & Fish House has operated in New Bedford since the early\u202f2000s, becoming a local landmark for New England seafood. It is referenced in corporate histories of regional restaurant chains.  \n- **Radio episode** \u2013 \u201cThe Black Whale\u201d was broadcast as part of the CBS Radio Mystery Theater anthology in 1975; the episode\u2019s plot involved a mysterious sea creature, reflecting the era\u2019s fascination with maritime horror stories.\n\n**Sources**  \n- *Not Your Average\u202fJoe\u2019s* Wikipedia entry \u2013 notes the acquisition of \u201cThe Black\u202fWhale\u201d restaurant in New\u202fBedford (shows the name\u2019s use as a real\u2011world eatery). \u3010https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Your_Average_Joe%27s\u3011 \u2013 local restaurant reference.  \n- *CBS Radio Mystery Theater* Wikipedia entry \u2013 lists \u201cThe Black Whale\u201d (Sept\u202f25\u202f1975) as one of the show\u2019s episodes (demonstrates the phrase\u2019s use in 1970s radio drama). \u3010https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Radio_Mystery_Theater\u3011 \u2013 episode title reference.  \n\n*No verifiable non\u2011crypto meme, slang, or TikTok\u2011style usage of \u201cThe Black Whale\u201d was found.*",
