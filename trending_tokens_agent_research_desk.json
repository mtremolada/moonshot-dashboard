A **seafood restaurant/bar** in New Bedford, Massachusetts called **The Black Whale** (often paired with \u201cThe Sail Loft\u201d).  \n  2. An **episode title** (\u201cThe Black Whale\u201d) of the classic U.S. radio series **CBS Radio Mystery Theater** (aired\u202fSeptember\u202f25\u202f1975).  \n\n**Origin / timeline**  \n- **Restaurant** \u2013 The Black Whale Bar & Fish House has operated in New Bedford since the early\u202f2000s, becoming a local landmark for New England seafood. It is referenced in corporate histories of regional restaurant chains.  \n- **Radio episode** \u2013 \u201cThe Black Whale\u201d was broadcast as part of the CBS Radio Mystery Theater anthology in 1975; the episode\u2019s plot involved a mysterious sea creature, reflecting the era\u2019s fascination with maritime horror stories.\n\n**Sources**  \n- *Not Your Average\u202fJoe\u2019s* Wikipedia entry \u2013 notes the acquisition of \u201cThe Black\u202fWhale\u201d restaurant in New\u202fBedford (shows the name\u2019s use as a real\u2011world eatery). \u3010https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Your_Average_Joe%27s\u3011 \u2013 local restaurant reference.  \n- *CBS Radio Mystery Theater* Wikipedia entry \u2013 lists \u201cThe Black Whale\u201d (Sept\u202f25\u202f1975) as one of the show\u2019s episodes (demonstrates the phrase\u2019s use in 1970s radio drama). \u3010https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Radio_Mystery_Theater\u3011 \u2013 episode title reference.  \n\n*No verifiable non\u2011crypto meme, slang, or TikTok\u2011style usage of \u201cThe Black Whale\u201d was found.*",

Summary \u2013 non\u2011crypto meaning of \u201cPippin\u201d**  \n- **Pippin** is most widely recognized as **Peregrin \u201cPippin\u201d Took**, a youthful hobbit from J.R.R.\u202fTolkien\u2019s *The Lord of the Rings* who, together with Merry, provides comic relief, bravery, and a \u201csmall\u2011but\u2011heroic\u201d archetype.  \n- The name also exists as an **old Frankish given name** (Pepin/Pippin) meaning \u201ca small apple\u201d or \u201ca young, fresh fruit,\u201d later borne by medieval royalty (e.g., Pepin the Short).  \n- In popular culture the term appears in the **1972 Broadway musical \u201cPippin,\u201d** about a young prince searching for meaning, further cementing the name as a symbol of youthful adventure and self\u2011discovery.\n\n**2. Origin / Timeline (cultural)**  \n- **c.\u202f8th\u202fcentury\u202f\u2013\u202f9th\u202fcentury:** \u201cPepin\u201d (Latin *Pippinus*) used among Frankish royalty (e.g., Pepin the Short, 714\u2011768).  \n- **1954\u20111955:** Tolkien publishes *The Lord of the Rings*; the character Pippin becomes a beloved figure in fantasy literature and later film (2001\u20112003).  \n- **1972:** Stephen Schwartz\u2019s musical *Pippin* premieres on Broadway, popularizing the name in theatre and later in TV/film adaptations.  \n- **2000s\u2011present:** \u201cPippin\u201d circulates as a meme\u2011friendly shorthand for a quirky, eager underdog (e.g., fan art, AI\u2011agent jokes referencing \u201cPippin the agent\u201d).  \n\n**3. Sources**  \n- **Peregrin \u201cPippin\u201d Took \u2013 Wikipedia** \u2013 details the hobbit character and his cultural impact.  \n- **Pippin (name) \u2013 Wikipedia** \u2013 explains the Frankish origin, meaning \u201cyoung apple,\u201d and historic bearers.  \n\nThese sources confirm that the token\u2019s name most plausibly draws on the well\u2011known literary/folk figure \u201cPippin\u201d rather than any crypto\u2011specific concept.",
