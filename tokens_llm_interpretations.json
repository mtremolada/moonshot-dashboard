Dunn drained $2 million worth of Solana from then-employer Pump.fun, and sent the funds to several random wallet addresses. Pump.fun has since grown into one of the most successful crypto projects, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue to date. Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE Canadian national Jarett Dunn was sentenced to six years in prison by a London judge on Thursday, Wood Green Crown Court told Decrypt . He had previously pleaded guilty to fraud by abuse of position and transfer of criminal property.

He then immediately admitted to the crime on social media. As such, the Canadian gained a cult-like following, with fans branding him a \u201ccrypto Robin Hood.\u201d Dunn\u2019s path to sentencing has been a rocky one, with several dates set, delayed, and adjourned. This included Dunn attempting to frame the attack as a whistleblower move , claiming that Pump.fun was a malicious site and that he was trying to warn people about it. However, with his sentence, it appears the judge wasn't too sympathetic to this argument. Pump.fun is a platform that allows anyone to create a crypto token in seconds, after filling out a short form. Dunn had been working as a senior developer for Pump.fun for six weeks before the incident, during which ... (truncated)",

Against all odds, we've made it to the end of another year, and what a year it's been, especially in the world of memes and internet culture. While 2025 might not have been the easiest or most hopeful year for a lot of people, it has done a lot to prove the old adage that hard times make strong memes. This year, it felt like we were met with a constant barrage of memes that were harder than ever to keep up with, thanks to the rise and advancement of AI , the fast growth of short-form content, the increasing acceptance of brainrot and other notable influences on meme culture.

Meanwhile, \" Cassius Thundercock \" became the face of police brutality, we learned a neat fact about buying a property in Egypt , the \" Cooked Dog \" warmed our souls, and we discovered that everything rhymes with Grug .

[ 1 ] They are usually crudely drawn in Microsoft Paint or other simple drawing programs, and were most popular in the early 2010s. [ 2 ] These webcomics have spread much in the same way that Internet memes do, and several memes have originated in this medium.

It was a simple 4-panel strip showing the author's anger about having water splash into their anus while on the toilet, with the final panel featuring a zoomed-in face, known as Rage Guy, saying \"FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-\". It was quickly reposted and modified, with other users creating new scenarios and characters. [ 5 ] [ better source needed ] Google Trends data shows that the term \"rage guy\" peaked in February 2012 while the terms \"rage comics\" and \"troll face\" both peaked at the same time. [ 2 ] The range of expression and standardized, easily identifiable faces has allowed uses such as teaching English as a foreign language .

Courtesy of the McGill family. By Grace Raynor Dec. 19, 2025 7:00 am EST Share Nolan McGill is only 11 but he understands when the time is right to take a stand. So the fifth-grader at Rivermont Elementary in Chattanooga, Tenn., concocted a plan. \u201cNolan had come home a few times saying, \u2018I\u2019m not singing Rocky Top,\u2019\u201d said his mom, Kelsey, of the famous bluegrass song that has become the University of Tennessee\u2019s unofficial anthem. \u201cAnd I was thinking, \u2018Why on earth would you sing Rocky Top?\u2019\u201d Advertisement Then Tuesday night \u2014 the evening of the school\u2019s holiday concert \u2014 rolled around and things started to click for Kelsey as she sat proudly in the audience. After Nolan and the school\u2019s third, fourth and fifth graders all sang three lovely holiday songs together, so began the beginning notes to the famous Tennessee tune. Ah. That\u2019s what Nolan had meant. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize (\u2018Rocky Top\u2019) was actually in the lineup,\u201d she said. \u201cHe actually was telling me that\u2019s part of the show.\u201d Kelsey immediately whipped out her cell phone and knew she had to film what was coming next. Nolan, an avid Georgia fan, wanted zero part of participating in the Vols\u2019 song. So instead, he crossed his arms, abruptly stopped singing and shook his head in disgust as his Tennessee-loving best friend belted out the words next to him. Kelsey, who can be heard cackling on the recording, posted the video to Facebook on Tuesday night, then made her first-ever TikTok on Wednesday. The video now has 3 million views and counting on social media \u2014 the college football world (sorry, Vols) loving every second. Young Georgia fan refuses to sing Rocky Top at school concert. Legend. pic.twitter.com/XULO13Vx7W \u2014 Dan Wetzel (@DanWetzel) December 18, 2025 \u201cIt\u2019s just a bad song. I\u2019m a Georgia fan,\u201d said Nolan, whose favorite Bulldog is quarterback Gunner Stockton. \u201cGeorgia\u2019s just better than Tenne... (truncated)",
