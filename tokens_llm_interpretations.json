The announcement that four-year-old Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei would head to China at the end of January - ahead of a February 20 deadline - was national news on Monday, disappointing a nation that has long had a love affair with pandas. Their move to China had long been planned, but Tokyo's loss is rich in symbolism as China-Japan relations have lately deteriorated due to geopolitical matters. Sign up here. Last month, Beijing was angered after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could trigger a military response from Tokyo - and tensions are still high.

In a space that\u2019s constantly loud, stressful, and overleveraged, PURK represents that moment when everything slows down \u2014 half-lidded eyes, no panic, no rush. Just calm confidence and vibes. At the same time, we watched Pepe evolve \u2014 from green to blue, then viral again as Purpe on Solana. It proved something important: color + familiarity + timing = virality. \u200b So we asked ourselves: What if Solana had its own viral purple Wojak? Wojak already represents emotion, sentiment, and the every-degen experience. Purple represents calm, creativity, and standing out in a sea of sameness. Combine that with the \u201cperc (perk) and chill\u201d mentality \u2014 and PURK was created. \u200b Not a copy. Not forced. Just a natural evolution of meme culture on Solana. \u200b \u200b Solana didn\u2019t need another loud meme. It needed a Purple Wojak. That\u2019s PURK. $PURK ARTWORK ARTWORK AND MEMES Roadmap ROADMAP PHASE 1 \u200b Purple Wojak introduced as the new face of chaos and comedy Branding locked in: artwork, memes, purple aesthetic, full identity Website goes live with clean visuals + clear mission Verified X profile secured Telegram surges as followers pile in for the PURK takeover Official token launch on Pump.fun Meme pushes, raid teams, and social exposure campaigns Enhanced token info updated on Dex / Dexscreener for polished presentation Listings on trackers + visibility integrations Collabs, partnerships, and expansion of the $PURK lore and character universe Strategic content drops + daily community engagement PHASE 2 Purple Wojak becomes a recognizable symbol across Solana culture Coordinated raids, campaigns, and high-impact community initiatives Ecosystem utilities & integrations rolled out as the project scales Continued growth through partnerships, content, and community strength $PURK solidifies itself as a top-tier meme force with lasting m...

The engine is designed to model everything else: agency, memory, emotion, drive, and goal setting. Think \"NextJS + Vercel for the minds of digital beings.\" It's run locally and containerized for cloud deployment. At its heart are two abstractions: WorkingMemory (an immutable collection of memories) and cognitiveSteps (functions that transform WorkingMemory and return typed responses). This functional, append-only approach made AI thought processes debuggable and predictable. Souls are orchestrated by MentalProcesses \u2014a state machine where each process defined a behavioral mode (e.g., \"introduction\", \"guessing\", \"frustrated\") that can transition to another, giving souls dynamic, context-aware behavior.

    "scraped_website_content": "Free the Crypto Prisoners The war on crypto is over. It\u2019s time to bring our innovators home. Across the world, innovators who built the foundations of cryptocurrency are being prosecuted under outdated laws. These \u201ccrypto prisoners of war\u201d are visionaries punished not for harming anyone, but for creating tools of freedom and financial independence. Roman Storm \u2014 Tornado Cash Developer Roman Storm, co-founder of the Tornado Cash privacy protocol, was arrested for writing open-source software that enhanced financial privacy on Ethereum. He faces criminal charges for code he published \u2014 not for harming or defrauding anyone. Tornado Cash is a tool, not a crime: millions used it for legal purposes including donations and privacy. Roman has raised nearly $300,000 in crypto for his legal defense, with strong support from the crypto community. His case could set a precedent criminalizing developers for code. Why It Matters: If Roman is convicted, no open-source developer is safe. Innovation itself will be on trial. Read more \u2192 Ian Freeman \u2014 Free Talk Live Libertarian radio host and activist Ian Freeman was sentenced to prison for running a Bitcoin exchange that helped people opt out of the banking system. He operated openly for years, helping thousands access cryptocurrency. Despite no evidence of harm, prosecutors portrayed voluntary Bitcoin sales as money laundering. He is serving an 8-year sentence for empowering people with financial freedom. Why It Matters: Ian\u2019s case shows how peaceful activism and voluntary exchange can be criminalized when it challenges government control of money.

Supporters describe him as a gentle, almost \u201cMr. Rogers-like\u201d figure \u2014 yet he has been targeted as a criminal mastermind without direct evidence tying him to wrongdoing.

Kingston belongs to the latter group, with the company's datacenter SSD business manager, Cameron Crandall, discussing this on The Full Nerd Network podcast. According to him, the NAND flash shortage is expected to significantly worsen in the next 30 days, leading to an increase in SSD prices from current levels. In 2025 alone, Kingston reports that NAND flash prices have surged by 246% from the first quarter until now, with 70% of that increase occurring in just the last 60 days. This indicates that many price hikes have already been integrated into the supply chain. Edward Crisler, the PR manager for Sapphire, advised PC gamers and potential buyers not to rush into panic buying. He stated, \"The good news is, I don't think the real pain we're experiencing now and for the next six months or so will last much longer than that.\" However, he also highlighted that the main challenge is the uncertainty of the situation. This uncertainty is causing OEMs to increase NAND flash contracts, where no one besides NAND flash manufacturers can predict what is exactly going on in the supply chain, and just how long the massive demand will outpace supply. No one is immune to the shortage, and the good old \"spinning rust,\" commonly known as Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), is another component affected by the increasing demand for storage during the AI boom. Reports indicate that negotiations for the fourth quarter of 2025 concluded with traditional HDD prices rising by about 4% quarter-over-quarter, marking the largest increase in the past eight quarters. It's not just NAND flash, which accounts for 90% of the bill of materials costs for traditional SSDs, but rather every availab... (truncated)",

Against all odds, we've made it to the end of another year, and what a year it's been, especially in the world of memes and internet culture. While 2025 might not have been the easiest or most hopeful year for a lot of people, it has done a lot to prove the old adage that hard times make strong memes. This year, it felt like we were met with a constant barrage of memes that were harder than ever to keep up with, thanks to the rise and advancement of AI , the fast growth of short-form content, the increasing acceptance of brainrot and other notable influences on meme culture. Between all the political turmoil, tragedies and little annoyances of the year, there was always a new meme or two to make everything a little more manageable, and now is the time for us to celebrate those memes that helped us laugh and smile through it all . Here are the top 20 memes of 2025, as voted by you, our beloved Know Your Meme users and most cherished meme lovers. Thank you for voting and thank you for memeing. See you in 2026! Honorable Mentions Before we bust into the top 20 memes of the year, here are some honorable mentions that didn't quite make it onto the list, but still hold a special place in our hearts and only just came up short. This year, the \" Meet Potential Man \" meme reached its full potential on Reddit, the white rabbit reminded us that time is running out , the \" Ok Garmin \" video became the soundtrack to all kinds of road accidents and the Eye of Rah brought brainrot to a new dimension. Meanwhile, \" Cassius Thundercock \" became the face of police brutality, we learned a neat fact about buying a property in Egypt , the \" Cooked Dog \" warmed our souls, and we discovered that everything rhymes with Grug . These memes may not have cracked the top 20, but they were all funny and me... (truncated)",
