The announcement that four-year-old Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei would head to China at the end of January - ahead of a February 20 deadline - was national news on Monday, disappointing a nation that has long had a love affair with pandas.

In a space that\u2019s constantly loud, stressful, and overleveraged, PURK represents that moment when everything slows down \u2014 half-lidded eyes, no panic, no rush. Just calm confidence and vibes. At the same time, we watched Pepe evolve \u2014 from green to blue, then viral again as Purpe on Solana. It proved something important: color + familiarity + timing = virality. \u200b So we asked ourselves: What if Solana had its own viral purple Wojak? Wojak already represents emotion, sentiment, and the every-degen experience. Purple represents calm, creativity, and standing out in a sea of sameness. Combine that with the \u201cperc (perk) and chill\u201d mentality \u2014 and PURK was created. \u200b Not a copy. Not forced. Just a natural evolution of meme culture on Solana. \u200b \u200b Solana didn\u2019t need another loud meme. It needed a Purple Wojak.

The engine is designed to model everything else: agency, memory, emotion, drive, and goal setting.

Souls are orchestrated by MentalProcesses \u2014a state machine where each process defined a behavioral mode (e.g., \"introduction\", \"guessing\", \"frustrated\") that can transition to another, giving souls dynamic, context-aware behavior.

Kingston belongs to the latter group, with the company's datacenter SSD business manager, Cameron Crandall, discussing this on The Full Nerd Network podcast. According to him, the NAND flash shortage is expected to significantly worsen in the next 30 days, leading to an increase in SSD prices from current levels. In 2025 alone, Kingston reports that NAND flash prices have surged by 246% from the first quarter until now, with 70% of that increase occurring in just the last 60 days. This indicates that many price hikes have already been integrated into the supply chain. Edward Crisler, the PR manager for Sapphire, advised PC gamers and potential buyers not to rush into panic buying. He stated, \"The good news is, I don't think the real pain we're experiencing now and for the next six months or so will last much longer than that.\" However, he also highlighted that the main challenge is the uncertainty of the situation. This uncertainty is causing OEMs to increase NAND flash contracts, where no one besides NAND flash manufacturers can predict what is exactly going on in the supply chain, and just how long the massive demand will outpace supply. No one is immune to the shortage, and the good old \"spinning rust,\" commonly known as Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), is another component affected by the increasing demand for storage during the AI boom. Reports indicate that negotiations for the fourth quarter of 2025 concluded with traditional HDD prices rising by about 4% quarter-over-quarter, marking the largest increase in the past eight quarters. It's not just NAND flash, which accounts for 90% of the bill of materials costs for traditional SSDs, but rather every availab... (truncated)",

Against all odds, we've made it to the end of another year, and what a year it's been, especially in the world of memes and internet culture. While 2025 might not have been the easiest or most hopeful year for a lot of people, it has done a lot to prove the old adage that hard times make strong memes. This year, it felt like we were met with a constant barrage of memes that were harder than ever to keep up with, thanks to the rise and advancement of AI , the fast growth of short-form content, the increasing acceptance of brainrot and other notable influences on meme culture. Between all the political turmoil, tragedies and little annoyances of the year, there was always a new meme or two to make everything a little more manageable, and now is the time for us to celebrate those memes that helped us laugh and smile through it all . Here are the top 20 memes of 2025, as voted by you, our beloved Know Your Meme users and most cherished meme lovers. Thank you for voting and thank you for memeing. See you in 2026! Honorable Mentions Before we bust into the top 20 memes of the year, here are some honorable mentions that didn't quite make it onto the list, but still hold a special place in our hearts and only just came up short. This year, the \" Meet Potential Man \" meme reached its full potential on Reddit, the white rabbit reminded us that time is running out , the \" Ok Garmin \" video became the soundtrack to all kinds of road accidents and the Eye of Rah brought brainrot to a new dimension. Meanwhile, \" Cassius Thundercock \" became the face of police brutality, we learned a neat fact about buying a property in Egypt , the \" Cooked Dog \" warmed our souls, and we discovered that everything rhymes with Grug . These memes may not have cracked the top 20, but they were all funny and me... (truncated)",

This included Dunn attempting to frame the attack as a whistleblower move , claiming that Pump.fun was a malicious site and that he was trying to warn people about it. However, with his sentence, it appears the judge wasn't too sympathetic to this argument. Pump.fun is a platform that allows anyone to create a crypto token in seconds, after filling out a short form. Dunn had been working as a senior developer for Pump.fun for six weeks before the incident, during which ... (truncated)",

Against all odds, we've made it to the end of another year, and what a year it's been, especially in the world of memes and internet culture.

    "scraped_website_content": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Internet meme The very first rage comic, originally published on 4chan in 2008 [ dubious \u2013 discuss ] A rage comic is a short cartoon strip using a growing set of pre-made cartoon faces, or rage faces , which usually express rage or some other simple emotion or activity. [ 1 ] They are usually crudely drawn in Microsoft Paint or other simple drawing programs, and were most popular in the early 2010s. [ 2 ] These webcomics have spread much in the same way that Internet memes do, and several memes have originated in this medium. They have been characterized by Ars Technica as an \"accepted and standardized form of online communication\". [ 3 ] The popularity of rage comics has been attributed to their use as vehicles for humorizing shared experiences. [ 4 ] History [ edit ] A man cosplaying as Rage Guy at Anime Los Angeles 2012 Although used on numerous websites such as Reddit , Cheezburger , ESS.MX, Ragestache, and 9GAG , the source of the rage comic has largely been attributed to 4chan in mid-2008. The first rage comic was posted to the 4chan /b/ \"Random\" board in 2008. It was a simple 4-panel strip showing the author's anger about having water splash into their anus while on the toilet, with the final panel featuring a zoomed-in face, known as Rage Guy, saying \"FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-\". It was quickly reposted and modified, with other users creating new scenarios and characters. [ 5 ] [ better source needed ] Google Trends data shows that the term \"rage guy\" peaked in February 2012 while the terms \"rage comics\" and \"troll face\" both peaked at the same time. [ 2 ] The range of expression and standardized, easily identifiable faces has allowed uses such as teaching English as a foreign language .

Courtesy of the McGill family. By Grace Raynor Dec. 19, 2025 7:00 am EST Share Nolan McGill is only 11 but he understands when the time is right to take a stand. So the fifth-grader at Rivermont Elementary in Chattanooga, Tenn., concocted a plan. \u201cNolan had come home a few times saying, \u2018I\u2019m not singing Rocky Top,\u2019\u201d said his mom, Kelsey, of the famous bluegrass song that has become the University of Tennessee\u2019s unofficial anthem. \u201cAnd I was thinking, \u2018Why on earth would you sing Rocky Top?\u2019\u201d Advertisement Then Tuesday night \u2014 the evening of the school\u2019s holiday concert \u2014 rolled around and things started to click for Kelsey as she sat proudly in the audience. After Nolan and the school\u2019s third, fourth and fifth graders all sang three lovely holiday songs together, so began the beginning notes to the famous Tennessee tune. Ah. That\u2019s what Nolan had meant. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize (\u2018Rocky Top\u2019) was actually in the lineup,\u201d she said. \u201cHe actually was telling me that\u2019s part of the show.\u201d Kelsey immediately whipped out her cell phone and knew she had to film what was coming next. Nolan, an avid Georgia fan, wanted zero part of participating in the Vols\u2019 song. So instead, he crossed his arms, abruptly stopped singing and shook his head in disgust as his Tennessee-loving best friend belted out the words next to him. Kelsey, who can be heard cackling on the recording, posted the video to Facebook on Tuesday night, then made her first-ever TikTok on Wednesday. The video now has 3 million views and counting on social media \u2014 the college football world (sorry, Vols) loving every second. Young Georgia fan refuses to sing Rocky Top at school concert. Legend. pic.twitter.com/XULO13Vx7W \u2014 Dan Wetzel (@DanWetzel) December 18, 2025 \u201cIt\u2019s just a bad song. I\u2019m a Georgia fan,\u201d said Nolan, whose favorite Bulldog is quarterback Gunner Stockton. \u201cGeorgia\u2019s just better than Tenne... (truncated)",
