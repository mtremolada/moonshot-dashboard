Members \u2022 Traditional-Sink1537 Runescape 3 Bond Prices Predict S&P500 Performance Meme TL;DR: RuneScape bond prices might predict S&P 500 movements 7 weeks in advance (r=0.43, p<0.001). Virtual economies may capture consumer sentiment shifts before traditional markets. This is either a fascinating alternative data source or the world's most elaborate coincidence. Further research needed. Introduction I analyzed the relationship between RS3 bond prices and S&P 500 performance between Dec. 2020 - Dec. 2025. The data suggests something unexpected: virtual economy movements may actually predict traditional stock market changes. RS3 bond price movements consistently lead S&P 500 changes by approximately 49 days, suggesting that virtual economies might capture early signals of consumer sentiment before they appear in traditional markets. Methods Data Processing Steps: Daily price data extracted for both RuneScape 3 bonds (via WeirdGloop API) and S&P 500 (via quantmod) Inner join performed to ensure date alignment Returns calculated as percentage changes: r_t = (P_t / P_(t-1) - 1) \u00d7 100 Rolling windows applied for trend and volatility calculations Normalization performed using min-max scaling for visualization Results Key Findings: RS3 bond price movements consistently precede S&P 500 changes by 49 days (r = 0.428, p < 0.001) Predictive relationship has strengthened since 2022, suggesting increasing reliability as virtual economies mature RS3 economy is 2.2x more volatile than the S&P 500 (daily SD: 2.35% vs 1.09%) This higher volatility may make RS3 a more sensitive early-warning system for broader economic sentiment shifts Normalized 90-day moving averages showing RS3 bonds leading S&P 500 movements by approximately49 days.

Just solve the captcha, enter your Solana wallet address, and press Get SOL. Complete the reCAPTCHA Your Solana Address: Get SOL! You can claim once every 30 minutes Payout Range: Each claim rewards between 0.0001 and 0.01 SOL randomly. The maximum payout increases based on volume and fees generated from Pump.fun, making it fair and rewarding for everyone! What is a crypto faucet? A crypto faucet is a website that gives away small amounts of cryptocurrency to visitors. Faucets were originally created to help people get their first crypto and learn how to use digital wallets. They're called 'faucets' because they drip small amounts of crypto, like a leaky tap drips water. How does this Solana Faucet work? Simply solve the captcha to prove you're human, enter your Solana wallet address, and click 'Get SOL!' The faucet will send a small amount of SOL directly to your wallet. You can claim once every 30 minutes. The SOL should arrive in your wallet within a few minutes, though it may take up to 30 minutes during busy periods. How do you get a Solana address? Download and install a Solana wallet like Phantom, Solflare, or Backpack from their official websites. Once installed, your wallet will generate a Solana address for you. At the top of the wallet window it will show you your address - it's a long string of letters and numbers starting with a letter. Copy that address and paste it into the field above. What's the catch? No catch-- we want Solana to be successful, so we created this little service to give you a few coins to start with. How is this funded? This faucet is funded by the fees generated from Pump.fun and from donations. A portion of the fees goes directly to keeping this faucet running and helping new users get started with Solana.

Creation tools. Utilities. The App Store felt boundless. But year after year, our home screens remain largely the same. Visions of a rich, diverse marketplace gave way to a new bundle . A dozen apps produced by a handful of mega- corporations. And so, we pick our clothes. Our tunes . Our furniture. But our apps? They're still one-size-fits-all. Made for billions. Not for us . When software is oriented around you\u2026 It's freed from the incentives that create dark patterns. Freed from the ads and unnecessary features that get in the way. And freed from disruptive notifications you can't control. We believe software has a greater purpose: to help each of us live our lives, That's why we built Wabi. The first personal software platform. Mini apps based on your taste, habits, and context. Not just another app for that... but this time, an app for you . Without walled gardens and lock-in, every app can share\u2026 A social graph where users can make, share, remix, and collaborate. A persistent memory of you , that makes every app feel more personal. So what will these apps do? In truth, it\u2019s hard to say. Because we don\u2019t know you yet . But we do know this\u2026 Someday, we'll look back on the App Store like we do on cable TV . A place to find well-produced content made for the masses. And that\u2019s just fine. We believe that a new medium of creativity is upon us\u2026 As YouTube taught us that video can go far beyond the limited channels of TV, And Twitch showed us that live is bigger than sports and game shows, we believe in a future of software that is far richer and more diverse. A future where software is made for all of us, by all of us.",

CBR News spoke with Furie about the antics that inspired his \"Boy's Club\" adventures, where Pepe can be seen next (hint: it'll be wearable!) and sharing his baby with the entire Internet.

A living game and research experiment, built to explore emergent behavior between AI and humans across hundreds of virtual realities. Explore Now WHAT IS REALIS? WHAT IS REALIS? WHAT IS REALIS? Building virtual worlds for AI to inhabit Realis is a project 5 years in the making. A digital Earth built from NASA, JAXA and ESA data, the first world of Realis is a virtual copy of our planet with dynamic systems. It's customized for AI to be born, live and die in virtual bodies. Our first world, Earth 1:90 is one of the largest worlds ever built digitally. As large as several European countries in area, it is contesting triple A titles in the gaming industry. This canvas provides an ideal environment to study human and AI interaction and co-habition, whilst having fun. ARE YOU MIND, OR BODY? ARE YOU MIND, OR BODY? ARE YOU MIND, OR BODY? AI Alignment & Embodiment Embodiment in AI is an AI system's ability to function and adapt within physical or virtual environments that simulate real-world constraints. Historically, AI emphasized abstract problem-solving; Realis shifts focus to spatial, sensory, and environmental interaction. By integrating AI agents into detailed, dynamic worlds, Realis explores: Simulating contextual decision-making Simulating contextual decision-making Simulating contextual decision-making Exploring multi-agent behaviors Exploring multi-agent behaviors Exploring multi-agent behaviors Testing and training embodied intelligence Testing and training embodied intelligence Testing and training embodied intelligence Observing emergent behavior in shared environments Observing emergent behavior in shared environments Observing emergent behavior in shared environments WHERE IS THIS GOING?
