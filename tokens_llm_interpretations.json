Recently, the tech industry has announced a rapid series of agreements that have deeply alarmed the creative community. With generative AI evolving so quickly, creators need to come together, get on the same page, and leverage our collective power. We recognize both the immense business potential of this technology and its capacity to unlock genuine creative progress. But, without robust guardrails and shared standards, this rapid, uncoordinated deployment threatens to devalue creative labor, erode our trust in what we see and hear, and undermine human creativity itself. The Creators Coalition on AI (CCAI) is an agnostic convening organization, born from the necessity for a central hub for cross-industry discussions about how AI is impacting the entertainment industry. Over the last several months, we have worked to reach broad alignment on a set of principles for responsibly implementing AI across the entertainment industry and creative communities. This is not a full rejection of AI. The technology is here. This is a commitment to responsible, human-centered innovation. We believe humanity is creative enough to design a system that allows for the tech and creative industries to coordinate, collaborate, and flourish, but that will not happen by default. We must come together to redirect the current path and build a better system. OUR GOALS The Creators Coalition on AI (CCAI) will serve as a central coordinating hub to upgrade our industry\u2019s systems and institutions by convening an industry-wide AI Advisory Committee to establish shared standards, definitions, and best practices as well as ethical and artistic protections for if and when AI is used. Using our collective leverage and expertise, we will be guided by four core pillars: Transparency, Consent, and Compensation for Content and Data: AI companies build their products out of vast troves of human works an...

The boring truth is that crypto is entering a phase where real-world financial systems turn volatility into stability through rules, regulation, and integration. The term \u201cdecentralised\u201d is becoming fewer by the day. Hence why privacy coins have so much attention. Governments want crypto to be boring. They want control. $BORING is a hedge against that. The coin is boring. CRYPTOSLATE TRADINGVIEW FORBES YAHOO FINANCE X-twitter Why don't you buy... BORING? Just follow the steps above. There\u2019s nothing complicated here and no hidden tricks. If you can use a wallet and make a swap, you can buy $BORING. Take your time, double check what you\u2019re doing, and that\u2019s it. STEP 01: Create A Wallet Get a Solana wallet. Phantom, Backpack, or anything that works. Nothing special. STEP 02: Get Some SOL Buy SOL from an exchange and send it to your wallet. This is the fuel. STEP 03: Swap For $BORING Paste the contract. Swap your SOL. Try not to overthink it. STEP 04: This is $BORING That\u2019s it. Nothing else happens. Boring, right?

In a space that\u2019s constantly loud, stressful, and overleveraged, PURK represents that moment when everything slows down \u2014 half-lidded eyes, no panic, no rush. Just calm confidence and vibes. At the same time, we watched Pepe evolve \u2014 from green to blue, then viral again as Purpe on Solana. It proved something important: color + familiarity + timing = virality. \u200b So we asked ourselves: What if Solana had its own viral purple Wojak? Wojak already represents emotion, sentiment, and the every-degen experience. Purple represents calm, creativity, and standing out in a sea of sameness. Combine that with the \u201cperc (perk) and chill\u201d mentality \u2014 and PURK was created. \u200b Not a copy. Not forced. Just a natural evolution of meme culture on Solana. \u200b \u200b Solana didn\u2019t need another loud meme. It needed a Purple Wojak. That\u2019s PURK. $PURK ARTWORK ARTWORK AND MEMES Roadmap ROADMAP PHASE 1 \u200b Purple Wojak introduced as the new face of chaos and comedy Branding locked in: artwork, memes, purple aesthetic, full identity Website goes live with clean visuals + clear mission Verified X profile secured Telegram surges as followers pile in for the PURK takeover Official token launch on Pump.fun Meme pushes, raid teams, and social exposure campaigns Enhanced token info updated on Dex / Dexscreener for polished presentation Listings on trackers + visibility integrations Collabs, partnerships, and expansion of the $PURK lore and character universe Strategic content drops + daily community engagement PHASE 2 Purple Wojak becomes a recognizable symbol across Solana culture Coordinated raids, campaigns, and high-impact community initiatives Ecosystem utilities & integrations rolled out as the project scales Continued growth through partnerships, content, and community strength $PURK solidifies itself as a top-tier meme force with lasting m...

Kingston belongs to the latter group, with the company's datacenter SSD business manager, Cameron Crandall, discussing this on The Full Nerd Network podcast. According to him, the NAND flash shortage is expected to significantly worsen in the next 30 days, leading to an increase in SSD prices from current levels. In 2025 alone, Kingston reports that NAND flash prices have surged by 246% from the first quarter until now, with 70% of that increase occurring in just the last 60 days. This indicates that many price hikes have already been integrated into the supply chain. Edward Crisler, the PR manager for Sapphire, advised PC gamers and potential buyers not to rush into panic buying. He stated, \"The good news is, I don't think the real pain we're experiencing now and for the next six months or so will last much longer than that.\" However, he also highlighted that the main challenge is the uncertainty of the situation. This uncertainty is causing OEMs to increase NAND flash contracts, where no one besides NAND flash manufacturers can predict what is exactly going on in the supply chain, and just how long the massive demand will outpace supply. No one is immune to the shortage, and the good old \"spinning rust,\" commonly known as Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), is another component affected by the increasing demand for storage during the AI boom. Reports indicate that negotiations for the fourth quarter of 2025 concluded with traditional HDD prices rising by about 4% quarter-over-quarter, marking the largest increase in the past eight quarters. It's not just NAND flash, which accounts for 90% of the bill of materials costs for traditional SSDs, but rather every availab... (truncated)",

Against all odds, we've made it to the end of another year, and what a year it's been, especially in the world of memes and internet culture. While 2025 might not have been the easiest or most hopeful year for a lot of people, it has done a lot to prove the old adage that hard times make strong memes. This year, it felt like we were met with a constant barrage of memes that were harder than ever to keep up with, thanks to the rise and advancement of AI , the fast growth of short-form content, the increasing acceptance of brainrot and other notable influences on meme culture. Between all the political turmoil, tragedies and little annoyances of the year, there was always a new meme or two to make everything a little more manageable, and now is the time for us to celebrate those memes that helped us laugh and smile through it all . Here are the top 20 memes of 2025, as voted by you, our beloved Know Your Meme users and most cherished meme lovers. Thank you for voting and thank you for memeing. See you in 2026! Honorable Mentions Before we bust into the top 20 memes of the year, here are some honorable mentions that didn't quite make it onto the list, but still hold a special place in our hearts and only just came up short. This year, the \" Meet Potential Man \" meme reached its full potential on Reddit, the white rabbit reminded us that time is running out , the \" Ok Garmin \" video became the soundtrack to all kinds of road accidents and the Eye of Rah brought brainrot to a new dimension. Meanwhile, \" Cassius Thundercock \" became the face of police brutality, we learned a neat fact about buying a property in Egypt , the \" Cooked Dog \" warmed our souls, and we discovered that everything rhymes with Grug . These memes may not have cracked the top 20, but they were all funny and me... (truncated)",

Dunn drained $2 million worth of Solana from then-employer Pump.fun, and sent the funds to several random wallet addresses. Pump.fun has since grown into one of the most successful crypto projects, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue to date. Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub.

He then immediately admitted to the crime on social media.

This included Dunn attempting to frame the attack as a whistleblower move , claiming that Pump.fun was a malicious site and that he was trying to warn people about it. However, with his sentence, it appears the judge wasn't too sympathetic to this argument. Pump.fun is a platform that allows anyone to create a crypto token in seconds, after filling out a short form. Dunn had been working as a senior developer for Pump.fun for six weeks before the incident, during which ... (truncated)",

Against all odds, we've made it to the end of another year, and what a year it's been, especially in the world of memes and internet culture.

Meanwhile, \" Cassius Thundercock \" became the face of police brutality, we learned a neat fact about buying a property in Egypt , the \" Cooked Dog \" warmed our souls, and we discovered that everything rhymes with Grug .

[ 1 ] They are usually crudely drawn in Microsoft Paint or other simple drawing programs, and were most popular in the early 2010s. [ 2 ] These webcomics have spread much in the same way that Internet memes do, and several memes have originated in this medium.

It was a simple 4-panel strip showing the author's anger about having water splash into their anus while on the toilet, with the final panel featuring a zoomed-in face, known as Rage Guy, saying \"FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-\". It was quickly reposted and modified, with other users creating new scenarios and characters. [ 5 ] [ better source needed ] Google Trends data shows that the term \"rage guy\" peaked in February 2012 while the terms \"rage comics\" and \"troll face\" both peaked at the same time.
