They\u2019re gone. The precious metal is relentlessly pushing higher, breaking every short-seller\u2019s dreams and portfolio. It\u2019s official \u2014 gold has gone full meme. The shiny metal that your grandparents swore by is now trending on Reddit threads, popping in Discord chats, and somehow getting the same hype energy as Nvidia NVDA in 2023 and Dogecoin DOGEUSD in 2021. Gold XAUUSD just crossed $4,200 per ounce early Wednesday, notching a 60% gain year-to-date \u2014 its best run in modern history and enough to make short-sellers lose sleep and tons of cash. Its market cap now sits near $30 trillion, which means there\u2019s more money parked in gold than the nominal GDP of every country not named the United States. Let\u2019s unpack what\u2019s fueling this blistering rally and why traders just can\u2019t stop buying. \ud83e\ude99 Gold as the Trade of 2025? Not too long ago, gold was a boring asset that just sat there like a pet rock. Not anymore. The OG store of value is finding new meaning as the \u201casset for uncertain times.\u201d That is, even amid an ongoing earnings season . What\u2019s driving it? Pretty much everything that usually rattles markets. \u2022 Rate cut expectations: The Fed\u2019s recent pivot toward easing has taken real yields lower \u2014 and gold loves that. Non-yielding assets look a lot more appealing when Treasuries don\u2019t pay much. \u2022 Geopolitical jitters: The Trump-Xi trade tension reboot has everyone looking for a hedge that doesn\u2019t involve a risk disclaimer the size of a novel. \u2022 ETF inflows: Gold-backed ETFs are hoovering up bullion at record pace as everyone seeks exposure to the precious metal. Add in central bank hoarding \u2014 especially from China, India, and Turkey \u2014 and you\u2019ve got a near-perfect cocktail for demand. \ud83d\udcb0 Meme Metal or Market Masterclass?

Catchphrases like, \"Whole time I'm watching the Bob,\" \"Whole time I'm drinking the Bob\" and \"The Bob got me crunk,\" popularized the term on platforms like TikTok .

Memes and other viral posts about drinking The Bob or watching The Bob when people expected the subject to be doing something else, like studying, trended in 2025. The joke originates from a 2023 TikTok video. As the meme evolved, internet users shared posts about other drinks using the likenesses of SpongeBob SquarePants characters. For instance, the Patrick Star drink was called \"The Rick\" and the Squidward Tentacles drink was called \"The Ward.\" Others used the phrasal template Teach Think I'm X, Whole Time I'm Watching the Y to joke about slacking by watching other TV shows and movies.

Creation tools. Utilities. The App Store felt boundless. But year after year, our home screens remain largely the same. Visions of a rich, diverse marketplace gave way to a new bundle . A dozen apps produced by a handful of mega- corporations. And so, we pick our clothes. Our tunes . Our furniture. But our apps? They're still one-size-fits-all. Made for billions. Not for us . When software is oriented around you\u2026 It's freed from the incentives that create dark patterns. Freed from the ads and unnecessary features that get in the way. And freed from disruptive notifications you can't control. We believe software has a greater purpose: to help each of us live our lives, That's why we built Wabi. The first personal software platform. Mini apps based on your taste, habits, and context. Not just another app for that... but this time, an app for you . Without walled gardens and lock-in, every app can share\u2026 A social graph where users can make, share, remix, and collaborate. A persistent memory of you , that makes every app feel more personal. So what will these apps do? In truth, it\u2019s hard to say. Because we don\u2019t know you yet . But we do know this\u2026 Someday, we'll look back on the App Store like we do on cable TV . A place to find well-produced content made for the masses. And that\u2019s just fine. We believe that a new medium of creativity is upon us\u2026 As YouTube taught us that video can go far beyond the limited channels of TV, And Twitch showed us that live is bigger than sports and game shows, we believe in a future of software that is far richer and more diverse. A future where software is made for all of us, by all of us.",

Gibson owned the dog when he was previously a member of 106 Squadron . Nigger often accompanied Gibson on training flights [ 1 ] and was a great favourite of the members of both 106 and 617 Squadrons. He was noted for his liking of beer, which he drank from his own bowl in the Officers' Mess.

Determined to rise above, Yawn is now launching his own venture with $YAWN , the world's first meme token that enables holders to earn profits from businesses and services developed under the Yawn's World brand. Our mission is to make Yawn's World a household name, fostering a community that amplifies our brand's influence. It's Yawn's world; you're just living in it.

Despite his relaxed nature, he had an air of mystery that intrigued those around him. Growing up, Yawn's favorite pastime was finding the perfect napping spots. He would explore fields, forests, and cozy corners of libraries, seeking out the best places to rest. His friends admired his ability to find tranquility amidst chaos, and they often joined him, lying in the grass or under a tree, talking about their dreams and aspirations.

This missed opportunity lingered in his mind, sparking a sense of determination he hadn't felt before. Determined to bring his own dream to life, Yawn's World began to share his philosophy of taking things slow and finding joy in the simple moments.

Building virtual worlds for AI to inhabit Realis is a project 5 years in the making. A digital Earth built from NASA, JAXA and ESA data, the first world of Realis is a virtual copy of our planet with dynamic systems. It's customized for AI to be born, live and die in virtual bodies. Our first world, Earth 1:90 is one of the largest worlds ever built digitally. As large as several European countries in area, it is contesting triple A titles in the gaming industry. This canvas provides an ideal environment to study human and AI interaction and co-habition, whilst having fun. ARE YOU MIND, OR BODY? ARE YOU MIND, OR BODY? ARE YOU MIND, OR BODY? AI Alignment & Embodiment Embodiment in AI is an AI system's ability to function and adapt within physical or virtual environments that simulate real-world constraints. Historically, AI emphasized abstract problem-solving; Realis shifts focus to spatial, sensory, and environmental interaction. By integrating AI agents into detailed, dynamic worlds, Realis explores: Simulating contextual decision-making Simulating contextual decision-making Simulating contextual decision-making Exploring multi-agent behaviors Exploring multi-agent behaviors Exploring multi-agent behaviors Testing and training embodied intelligence Testing and training embodied intelligence Testing and training embodied intelligence Observing emergent behavior in shared environments Observing emergent behavior in shared environments Observing emergent behavior in shared environments WHERE IS THIS GOING?

Members \u2022 Traditional-Sink1537 Runescape 3 Bond Prices Predict S&P500 Performance Meme TL;DR: RuneScape bond prices might predict S&P 500 movements 7 weeks in advance (r=0.43, p<0.001). Virtual economies may capture consumer sentiment shifts before traditional markets. This is either a fascinating alternative data source or the world's most elaborate coincidence. Further research needed. Introduction I analyzed the relationship between RS3 bond prices and S&P 500 performance between Dec. 2020 - Dec. 2025. The data suggests something unexpected: virtual economy movements may actually predict traditional stock market changes. RS3 bond price movements consistently lead S&P 500 changes by approximately 49 days, suggesting that virtual economies might capture early signals of consumer sentiment before they appear in traditional markets. Methods Data Processing Steps: Daily price data extracted for both RuneScape 3 bonds (via WeirdGloop API) and S&P 500 (via quantmod) Inner join performed to ensure date alignment Returns calculated as percentage changes: r_t = (P_t / P_(t-1) - 1) \u00d7 100 Rolling windows applied for trend and volatility calculations Normalization performed using min-max scaling for visualization Results Key Findings: RS3 bond price movements consistently precede S&P 500 changes by 49 days (r = 0.428, p < 0.001) Predictive relationship has strengthened since 2022, suggesting increasing reliability as virtual economies mature RS3 economy is 2.2x more volatile than the S&P 500 (daily SD: 2.35% vs 1.09%) This higher volatility may make RS3 a more sensitive early-warning system for broader economic sentiment shifts Normalized 90-day moving averages showing RS3 bonds leading S&P 500 movements by approximately49 days.

Just solve the captcha, enter your Solana wallet address, and press Get SOL. Complete the reCAPTCHA Your Solana Address: Get SOL! You can claim once every 30 minutes Payout Range: Each claim rewards between 0.0001 and 0.01 SOL randomly. The maximum payout increases based on volume and fees generated from Pump.fun, making it fair and rewarding for everyone! What is a crypto faucet? A crypto faucet is a website that gives away small amounts of cryptocurrency to visitors. Faucets were originally created to help people get their first crypto and learn how to use digital wallets. They're called 'faucets' because they drip small amounts of crypto, like a leaky tap drips water. How does this Solana Faucet work? Simply solve the captcha to prove you're human, enter your Solana wallet address, and click 'Get SOL!' The faucet will send a small amount of SOL directly to your wallet. You can claim once every 30 minutes. The SOL should arrive in your wallet within a few minutes, though it may take up to 30 minutes during busy periods. How do you get a Solana address? Download and install a Solana wallet like Phantom, Solflare, or Backpack from their official websites. Once installed, your wallet will generate a Solana address for you. At the top of the wallet window it will show you your address - it's a long string of letters and numbers starting with a letter. Copy that address and paste it into the field above. What's the catch? No catch-- we want Solana to be successful, so we created this little service to give you a few coins to start with. How is this funded? This faucet is funded by the fees generated from Pump.fun and from donations. A portion of the fees goes directly to keeping this faucet running and helping new users get started with Solana.
