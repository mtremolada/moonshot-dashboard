    "scraped_website_content": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Internet meme The very first rage comic, originally published on 4chan in 2008 [ dubious \u2013 discuss ] A rage comic is a short cartoon strip using a growing set of pre-made cartoon faces, or rage faces , which usually express rage or some other simple emotion or activity. [ 1 ] They are usually crudely drawn in Microsoft Paint or other simple drawing programs, and were most popular in the early 2010s. [ 2 ] These webcomics have spread much in the same way that Internet memes do, and several memes have originated in this medium. They have been characterized by Ars Technica as an \"accepted and standardized form of online communication\". [ 3 ] The popularity of rage comics has been attributed to their use as vehicles for humorizing shared experiences. [ 4 ] History [ edit ] A man cosplaying as Rage Guy at Anime Los Angeles 2012 Although used on numerous websites such as Reddit , Cheezburger , ESS.MX, Ragestache, and 9GAG , the source of the rage comic has largely been attributed to 4chan in mid-2008. The first rage comic was posted to the 4chan /b/ \"Random\" board in 2008. It was a simple 4-panel strip showing the author's anger about having water splash into their anus while on the toilet, with the final panel featuring a zoomed-in face, known as Rage Guy, saying \"FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-\". It was quickly reposted and modified, with other users creating new scenarios and characters. [ 5 ] [ better source needed ] Google Trends data shows that the term \"rage guy\" peaked in February 2012 while the terms \"rage comics\" and \"troll face\" both peaked at the same time. [ 2 ] The range of expression and standardized, easily identifiable faces has allowed uses such as teaching English as a foreign language .

Courtesy of the McGill family. By Grace Raynor Dec. 19, 2025 7:00 am EST Share Nolan McGill is only 11 but he understands when the time is right to take a stand. So the fifth-grader at Rivermont Elementary in Chattanooga, Tenn., concocted a plan. \u201cNolan had come home a few times saying, \u2018I\u2019m not singing Rocky Top,\u2019\u201d said his mom, Kelsey, of the famous bluegrass song that has become the University of Tennessee\u2019s unofficial anthem. \u201cAnd I was thinking, \u2018Why on earth would you sing Rocky Top?\u2019\u201d Advertisement Then Tuesday night \u2014 the evening of the school\u2019s holiday concert \u2014 rolled around and things started to click for Kelsey as she sat proudly in the audience. After Nolan and the school\u2019s third, fourth and fifth graders all sang three lovely holiday songs together, so began the beginning notes to the famous Tennessee tune. Ah. That\u2019s what Nolan had meant. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize (\u2018Rocky Top\u2019) was actually in the lineup,\u201d she said. \u201cHe actually was telling me that\u2019s part of the show.\u201d Kelsey immediately whipped out her cell phone and knew she had to film what was coming next. Nolan, an avid Georgia fan, wanted zero part of participating in the Vols\u2019 song. So instead, he crossed his arms, abruptly stopped singing and shook his head in disgust as his Tennessee-loving best friend belted out the words next to him. Kelsey, who can be heard cackling on the recording, posted the video to Facebook on Tuesday night, then made her first-ever TikTok on Wednesday. The video now has 3 million views and counting on social media \u2014 the college football world (sorry, Vols) loving every second. Young Georgia fan refuses to sing Rocky Top at school concert. Legend. pic.twitter.com/XULO13Vx7W \u2014 Dan Wetzel (@DanWetzel) December 18, 2025 \u201cIt\u2019s just a bad song. I\u2019m a Georgia fan,\u201d said Nolan, whose favorite Bulldog is quarterback Gunner Stockton. \u201cGeorgia\u2019s just better than Tenne... (truncated)",

The demonstrations erupted on Thursday as EU leaders gathered for a summit where the fate of the Mercosur deal hung in the balance.

Outside the gilded halls on the streets, farmers hurled potatoes and eggs at police, set off fireworks and firecrackers, and brought traffic to a standstill. Authorities responded with tear gas and water cannon, setting up roadblocks and closing tunnels around the city.

Canton police said the officer responded around 1:45 p.m. to the Walmart on Atlantic Boulevard NE for suspected shoplifting. The officer was inside the loss prevention office with Shane Newman, 21, and Katerina Jeffrey, 23, when police say Newman pulled out a handgun. Court records show Shane Newman, 21 of Plain Township, was charged with attempted murder, felonious assault on a police officer, robbery, drug possession and having a weapon under disability. (Source: Stark County Jail) According to police, Newman attempted to shoot the officer but the gun did not fire. A Walmart asset protection associate jumped onto Newman before he could try to shoot the gun again. Newman was taken to the floor by the officer and arrested. In the body camera video, the officer explains he didn\u2019t shoot Newman because he didn\u2019t want to hit the Walmart employee that was on top of him. \u201cThe safety and security of our customers and associates is always a top priority. We\u2019re proud of the brave action our asset protection associate took to maintain the safety of everyone in our store.

Forum BOOK BOOK #2 The Alot is Better Than You at Everything As a grammatically conscientious person who frequents internet forums and YouTube, I have found it necessary to develop a few coping mechanisms. When someone types out \"u\" instead of \"you,\" instead of getting mad, I imagine them having only one finger on each hand and then their actions seem reasonable. If I only had one finger on each hand, I'd leave out unnecessary letters too! If I come across a person who seems to completely ignore the existence of apostrophes and capital letters and types things like \"im an eagle and im typing with my talons, so dont make fun of me cuz this is hard,\" I like to imagine that they actually are an eagle typing with their talons. It would be a hassle if you had to hop in the air and use your feet to karate-chop two keys simultaneously every time you wanted to use the shift key to make a capital letter. Also, eagles lack manual dexterity, so I can understand why they'd want to leave out apostrophes. Eagles are all about efficiency. But there is one grammatical mistake that I particularly enjoy encountering. It has become almost fun for me to come across people who take the phrase \"a lot\" and condense it down into one word, because when someone says \"alot,\" this is what I imagine: The Alot is an imaginary creature that I made up to help me deal with my compulsive need to correct other people's grammar. It kind of looks like a cross between a bear, a yak and a pug, and it has provided hours of entertainment for me in a situation where I'd normally be left feeling angry and disillusioned with the world. For example, when I read the sentence \"I care about this alot,\" this is what I imagine: Similarly, when someone says \"alot of _______\", I picture an Alot made out of whatever they are talking about. If someone says something like \"I feel lonely alot\" or \"I'm angry alot,\" I'm going to imagine them standing there... (truncated)",

For the most conspicuous species colloquially called tumbleweed in the U.S., see Salsola tragus . For other uses, see Tumbleweed (disambiguation) . Lechenaultia divaricata A tumbleweed is any structural part of the above-ground anatomy of a number of species of plants . It is a diaspore that, once mature and dry, detaches from its root or stem and rolls due to the force of the wind . It is also the name used for these types of plants . In most such species, the tumbleweed is in effect the entire plant apart from the root system, but in other plants, a hollow fruit or inflorescence might detach instead. [ 1 ] Xerophyte tumbleweed species occur most commonly in steppe and arid ecosystems , where frequent wind and the open environment permit rolling without prohibitive obstruction. [ 2 ] Apart from its primary vascular system and roots, the tissues of the tumbleweed structure are dead; their death is functional because it is necessary for the structure to degrade gradually and fall apart so that its seeds or spores can escape during the tumbling, or germinate after the tumbleweed has come to rest in a moist location. In the latter case, many species of tumbleweed open mechanically, releasing their seeds as they swell when they absorb water. [ 3 ] The tumbleweed diaspore disperses seeds, but the tumbleweed strategy is not limited to the seed plants ; some species of spore-bearing cryptogams \u2014such as Selaginella \u2014form tumbleweeds, and some fungi that resemble puffballs dry out, break free of their attachments and are similarly tumbled by the wind, dispersing spores as they go.

The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history. History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were \"resolved\" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations. The main site for Archive Team is at archiveteam.org and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs. This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the Wayback Machine , providing a path back to lost websites and work. Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.

Verdot is also known for creating the original \"RAWR I AM A LION\" image of which the JESUS CHRIST IT'S A LION GET IN THE CAR! meme is half-based on. Origin On June 2006, Verdot created a cartoon man on MS Paint and afterward posted it on 4chan 's /b/ board. After making some other variations of his own (such as one that references the FGSFDS meme ), other Anonymous people started joining in on creating shopped images of the cartoon figure. When multiple users began creating their own, it was safe to call this a meme. Spread Over 800 pages on DeviantArt make mention of Optimized GIF Dude, as do a handful of 4chan archive threads. Optimized GIF Dude's popularity elsewhere remains to be seen. On 4chanarchive WARNING: 4chanarchive threads are NSFW. January 26th, 2007: 19647598 is an image dump of Optimized Gif Dude images.. September 8th, 2007: 5907141 also features an Optimized Gif Dude appearance. Further mentions of Optimized Gif Dude on 4chanarchive available here .

For more detail on our views, see here .) 3 What is this? How did we write it? Why is it valuable? Who are we? The CEOs of OpenAI , Google DeepMind , and Anthropic have all predicted that AGI will arrive within the next 5 years. Sam Altman has said OpenAI is setting its sights on \u201csuperintelligence in the true sense of the word\u201d and the \u201cglorious future.\u201d What might that look like? We wrote AI 2027 to answer that question. Claims about the future are often frustratingly vague, so we tried to be as concrete and quantitative as possible, even though this means depicting one of many possible futures. We wrote two endings: a \u201cslowdown\u201d and a \u201crace\u201d ending. However, AI 2027 is not a recommendation or exhortation. Our goal is predictive accuracy. 4 We encourage you to debate and counter this scenario. 5 We hope to spark a broad conversation about where we\u2019re headed and how to steer toward positive futures. We\u2019re planning to give out thousands in prizes to the best alternative scenarios. Our research on key questions (e.g. what goals will future AI agents have?) can be found here . The scenario itself was written iteratively: we wrote the first period (up to mid-2025), then the following period, etc. until we reached the ending. We then scrapped this and did it again. We weren\u2019t trying to reach any particular ending. After we finished the first ending\u2014which is now colored red\u2014we wrote a new alternative branch because we wanted to also depict a mo...
