For more detail on our views, see here .) 3 What is this? How did we write it? Why is it valuable? Who are we? The CEOs of OpenAI , Google DeepMind , and Anthropic have all predicted that AGI will arrive within the next 5 years. Sam Altman has said OpenAI is setting its sights on \u201csuperintelligence in the true sense of the word\u201d and the \u201cglorious future.\u201d What might that look like? We wrote AI 2027 to answer that question. Claims about the future are often frustratingly vague, so we tried to be as concrete and quantitative as possible, even though this means depicting one of many possible futures. We wrote two endings: a \u201cslowdown\u201d and a \u201crace\u201d ending. However, AI 2027 is not a recommendation or exhortation. Our goal is predictive accuracy. 4 We encourage you to debate and counter this scenario. 5 We hope to spark a broad conversation about where we\u2019re headed and how to steer toward positive futures. We\u2019re planning to give out thousands in prizes to the best alternative scenarios. Our research on key questions (e.g. what goals will future AI agents have?) can be found here . The scenario itself was written iteratively: we wrote the first period (up to mid-2025), then the following period, etc. until we reached the ending. We then scrapped this and did it again. We weren\u2019t trying to reach any particular ending. After we finished the first ending\u2014which is now colored red\u2014we wrote a new alternative branch because we wanted to also depict a mo...

The release of thousands of pages of documents related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's abuse by the US department of justice (DOJ) has left some who were anxiously awaiting the files disappointed. By law, the DOJ had to make all materials public by the end of Friday. But only some have been released, many with numerous redactions. The lawmakers who pushed for these documents to see the light of day have described the DOJ's efforts as insincere, and some legal experts say that the redactions may only fuel ongoing conspiracy theories. \"We just want all of the evidence of these crimes out there,\" Epstein survivor Liz Stein told the BBC.

Survivors are really worried about the possibility of a \"slow roll-out of incomplete information without any context\", she noted. Marina Lacerda, who was 14 when she was abused by Epstein, also told the BBC some of the survivors were \"still nervous and sceptical about how they are going to release the rest of the files\". \"We are very worried that it will still be redacted in the same way that it was today. \"We are a little disappointed that they're now still lingering on and distracting us with other things.\" US Department of Justice Epstein poses with Michael Jackson Among the latest released information is a photo of Epstein now jailed confidante Ghislaine Maxwell outside Downing Street - the UK prime minister's office and residence - a document that claims Epstein introduced a 14-year-old girl to US President Donald Trump at Mar-a-La...

They\u2019re gone. The precious metal is relentlessly pushing higher, breaking every short-seller\u2019s dreams and portfolio. It\u2019s official \u2014 gold has gone full meme. The shiny metal that your grandparents swore by is now trending on Reddit threads, popping in Discord chats, and somehow getting the same hype energy as Nvidia NVDA in 2023 and Dogecoin DOGEUSD in 2021. Gold XAUUSD just crossed $4,200 per ounce early Wednesday, notching a 60% gain year-to-date \u2014 its best run in modern history and enough to make short-sellers lose sleep and tons of cash. Its market cap now sits near $30 trillion, which means there\u2019s more money parked in gold than the nominal GDP of every country not named the United States.

Pretty much everything that usually rattles markets. \u2022 Rate cut expectations: The Fed\u2019s recent pivot toward easing has taken real yields lower \u2014 and gold loves that. Non-yielding assets look a lot more appealing when Treasuries don\u2019t pay much. \u2022 Geopolitical jitters: The Trump-Xi trade tension reboot has everyone looking for a hedge that doesn\u2019t involve a risk disclaimer the size of a novel. \u2022 ETF inflows: Gold-backed ETFs are hoovering up bullion at record pace as everyone seeks exposure to the precious metal. Add in central bank hoarding \u2014 especially from China, India, and Turkey \u2014 and you\u2019ve got a near-perfect cocktail for demand. \ud83d\udcb0 Meme Metal or Market Masterclass?

Catchphrases like, \"Whole time I'm watching the Bob,\" \"Whole time I'm drinking the Bob\" and \"The Bob got me crunk,\" popularized the term on platforms like TikTok . A copypasta roughly reading, \"The Bob\" \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I'm Crine Bru , also caused the term to trend online. Memes and other viral posts about drinking The Bob or watching The Bob when people expected the subject to be doing something else, like studying, trended in 2025. The joke originates from a 2023 TikTok video. As the meme evolved, internet users shared posts about other drinks using the likenesses of SpongeBob SquarePants characters. For instance, the Patrick Star drink was called \"The Rick\" and the Squidward Tentacles drink was called \"The Ward.\" Others used the phrasal template Teach Think I'm X, Whole Time I'm Watching the Y to joke about slacking by watching other TV shows and movies.

    "scraped_website_content": "Announcing our $20m Pre\u2011Seed Many years ago, Apple told us: there was \"an app for that\" . And for a while, it felt like there was. Social media. Games. Creation tools. Utilities. The App Store felt boundless. But year after year, our home screens remain largely the same. Visions of a rich, diverse marketplace gave way to a new bundle . A dozen apps produced by a handful of mega- corporations. And so, we pick our clothes. Our tunes . Our furniture. But our apps? They're still one-size-fits-all. Made for billions. Not for us . When software is oriented around you\u2026 It's freed from the incentives that create dark patterns. Freed from the ads and unnecessary features that get in the way. And freed from disruptive notifications you can't control. We believe software has a greater purpose: to help each of us live our lives, That's why we built Wabi. The first personal software platform. Mini apps based on your taste, habits, and context. Not just another app for that... but this time, an app for you . Without walled gardens and lock-in, every app can share\u2026 A social graph where users can make, share, remix, and collaborate. A persistent memory of you , that makes every app feel more personal. So what will these apps do? In truth, it\u2019s hard to say. Because we don\u2019t know you yet . But we do know this\u2026 Someday, we'll look back on the App Store like we do on cable TV . A place to find well-produced content made for the masses. And that\u2019s just fine. We believe that a new medium of creativity is upon us\u2026 As YouTube taught us that video can go far beyond the limited channels of TV, And Twitch showed us that live is bigger than sports and game shows, we believe in a future of software that is far richer and more diverse. A future where software is made for all of us, by all of us.",

Upon the release of the game in November 2014, many players of the video game mocked the funeral cutscene for its forced element of interactivity that seemed out-of-place at a memorial service. Origin On November 4th, 2014, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare was released. In the opening scene from the game's second mission, the protagonist Private Jack Mitchell attends the funeral of his best friend who died fighting in South Korea.

Gibson owned the dog when he was previously a member of 106 Squadron . Nigger often accompanied Gibson on training flights [ 1 ] and was a great favourite of the members of both 106 and 617 Squadrons. He was noted for his liking of beer, which he drank from his own bowl in the Officers' Mess.

He was buried at midnight as Gibson was leading the raid. \"Nigger\" ( Morse code : -. .. --. --. . .-. ) was the codeword Gibson used to confirm the breach of the M\u00f6hne Dam . Nigger's grave is at Royal Air Force station Scampton , Lincolnshire . [ 1 ] In July 2020 the headstone was replaced, with his name removed. The RAF said it \"did not want to give prominence to an offensive term that went against its ethos\".
